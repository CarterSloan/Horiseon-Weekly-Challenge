# Code Refactor Starter Code

I edited this html to reflect semantic elements. I changed div to article or section. I added image alts and notes to reflect changes and denote different sections. 

For the css document, I changed the code to reflect changes made to htlm document, and rearranged code to make it more linear and to reflect the structure of the html document.
